**Intro**

Welcome to the course wiki for [Topics Social Data Science](https://kurser.ku.dk/course/a%C3%98kk08371u/2017-2018) offered by the University of Copenhagen. This is the main page where you will find all the info you need about the course. The main thing you want to look for here is the weekly updated *course plan* (below), which presents the preparations you need to make before coming to class and links you to the exercises you will be working on after each lecture. In the side-bar, there are pages where you can read about important details of the course, such as course preparation, timeline, assignments, evaluation and more.

Before the course starts we expect that you have [prepared for the course](https://github.com/abjer/tsds/wiki/Course-preparation).
