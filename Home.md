**Intro**

Welcome to the course wiki for [Topics Social Data Science](https://kurser.ku.dk/course/a%C3%98kk08371u/2017-2018) offered by the University of Copenhagen. This is the wiki page for the course, where you will find all the info you need. The main thing you want to look for here is *course plan* (see below), which outlines the content of each coming session. You'll see that it has most of the sessions sketched out, but as we go information will be added, indicating what you should expect from each session and what you must prepare.

In the side-bar, there are pages where you can read about other important details of the course, such as general course preparation, the timeline, assignments, evaluation and more. The teaching will consist of a weekly session with lectures and exercises. The sessions are held **Thursday afternoon 13-17 in CSS 35-0-12**.

Finally, have a look at the `<> Code` tab (above, left). That's where we will be sharing all the files used in the course, which includes exercises and assignments mostly.

Before the course starts we expect that you have [prepared for the course](https://github.com/abjer/tsds/wiki/Course-preparation).

**Course plan**

* Week 1 (Feb. 8): *Introduction and Python*. [UA] This is *get started week*. The lecture will introduce the course, how it works, what you can expect to learn and what we expect you to deliver. We will introduce the idea of social data science and why it's important, motivate the use of Python and introduce some of the tools you will be learning. The exercises will be part install party to ensure everyone is up to speed on the technological side, and part Python exercises teaching you how to work with data practically.

    * *Preparation*: Get set up with Python, learn the basics if you haven't already and read about social data science. But above all, [prepare for the course](https://github.com/abjer/tsds/wiki/Course-preparation).

        * Download and install **Python 3.6** from the [Anaconda distribution](https://www.anaconda.com/download/#macos) (not version 2.7).

* Week 2 (Feb. 15): *Scraping and structuring*. [SR/ABN] Data scraping, merging, structuring.

* Week 3 (Feb. 22): *Data modelling*. [ABN] Short recap of basic machine learning concepts.

* Week 4 (Mar. 1): *Networks 1*. [UA] Introduction to networks: types, applications and limitations. Representing and describing networks.

* Week 5 (Mar. 8): *Networks 2*. [UA] Processes on networks: clustering and spreading. Null models.

* Week 6 (Mar. 15): *Spatial data*. [ABN] Learn to efficiently use geolocation data. Topics including working spatial shapes (polygons, lines etc.) and methods for storage, manipulation, changing coordinate system, feature extraction as well as plotting data.

* Week 7 (Mar. 22): *Text*. [SR] Vectorization, transformations, graphbased and latent representations of text. 

* Week 8 (Apr. 5): *Machine learning 1*. [UA] Introduction to machine learning. Model fitting (underfitting/overfitting), bias/variance tradeoff, model evaluation (training, testing, cross-validation, performance measures).

* Week 9 (Apr. 12): *Machine learning 2*. [SR] This lecture will focus on how to improve your models using unsupervised learning, semi-supervised learning, and transfer learning. The focus is on feature engineering, learning from unlabeled data and transferring knowledge from other learning tasks.

* Week 10 (Apr. 19): *Natural language processing*. [SR] Design and train classifiers on text to scale qualitative evaluations. 

* Week 11 (Apr. 26): *Machine learning 3*. [ABN] We will focus on machine learning and causality. In particular we will use some of the newer methods that are hybrids of machine learning and causal inference e.g. [recursive partitioning of trees](http://www.pnas.org/content/113/27/7353.full)

* Week 12 (May 3): *Wrap-up/project work*.

* Week 13: *Project work*.

* Week 14: *Project work*
