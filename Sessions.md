**Week 1: Introduction and data wrangling.** Install party, short recap of basic Python and Pandas. Getting started with the Twitter API.

**Week 2: Scraping and structuring.** Data scraping, merging, structuring.

**Week 3: Data exploration.** Short recap of exploratory data analysis and basic machine learning concepts.

**Week 4: Networks 1.** Introduction to networks: types, applications and limitations. Representing and describing networks.

**Week 5: Networks 2.** Processes on networks: clustering and spreading. Null models.

**Week 6: Spatial data.** Learn to efficiently use geolocation data. Topics including working spatial shapes (polygons, lines etc.) and methods for storage, manipulation, changing coordinate system, feature extraction as well as plotting data.

**Week 7: Text** Vectorization, transformations, graphbased and latent representations of text. 

**Week 8: Machine learning 1**. Introduction to machine learning. Model fitting (underfitting/overfitting), bias/variance tradeoff, model evaluation (training, testing, cross-validation, performance measures).

**Week 9: Machine learning 2**. *ULF: We need to discuss what exactly goes in here. Since the first ML lecture introduces the whole methodological framework, we could go in depth with how different classifiers work?*

**Week 10: Machine learning 3** In the second part of the lecture we will focus on machine learning and causality. In particular we will use some of the newer methods that are hybrids of machine learning and causal inference e.g. [recursive partitioning of trees](http://www.pnas.org/content/113/27/7353.full)

**Week 11: Natural language processing.** Design and train classifiers on text to scale qualitative evaluations. 

**Week 12: Wrap-up/project work.**

**Week 13: Project work.**

**Week 14: Project work**
