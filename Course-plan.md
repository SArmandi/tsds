This is the (preliminary) plan for the course. The teaching will consist of a weekly session with lectures and exercises. The sessions are held Thursday afternoon 13-17 in CSS 2.1.30. 

***

**Week 1 (Feb. 8): Introduction and data wrangling.** [UA] This is *get started week*. The lecture will introduce the course, how it works, what you can expect to learn and what we expect you to deliver. We will introduce the idea of social data science and why it's important, motivate the use of Python and introduce some of the tools you will be learning. The exercises will be part install party to ensure everyone is up to speed on the technological side, and part Python exercises teaching you how to collect data from the Twitter API.

*Preparation:* Get set up with Python, learn the basics if you haven't already, read about social data science and learn about the Twitter API.

* Download and install **Python 3.6** from the [Anaconda distribution](https://www.anaconda.com/download/#macos) (not version 2.7).

**Week 2 (Feb. 15): Scraping and structuring.** [SR/ABN] Data scraping, merging, structuring.

**Week 3 (Feb. 22): Data exploration.** [ABN] Short recap of exploratory data analysis and basic machine learning concepts.

**Week 4 (Mar. 1): Networks 1.** [UA] Introduction to networks: types, applications and limitations. Representing and describing networks.

**Week 5 (Mar. 8): Networks 2.** [UA] Processes on networks: clustering and spreading. Null models.

**Week 6 (Mar. 15): Spatial data.** [ABN] Learn to efficiently use geolocation data. Topics including working spatial shapes (polygons, lines etc.) and methods for storage, manipulation, changing coordinate system, feature extraction as well as plotting data.

**Week 7 (Mar. 22): Text.** [SR] Vectorization, transformations, graphbased and latent representations of text. 

**Week 8 (Apr. 5): Machine learning 1.** [UA] Introduction to machine learning. Model fitting (underfitting/overfitting), bias/variance tradeoff, model evaluation (training, testing, cross-validation, performance measures).

**Week 9 (Apr. 12): Machine learning 2**. [SR] This lecture will focus on how to improve your models using unsupervised learning, semi-supervised learning, and transfer learning. The focus is on feature engineering, learning from unlabeled data and transfering knowledge from other learning tasks.

**Week 10 (Apr. 19): Natural language processing.** [SR] Design and train classifiers on text to scale qualitative evaluations. 

**Week 11 (Apr. 26): Machine learning 3.** [ABN] We will focus on machine learning and causality. In particular we will use some of the newer methods that are hybrids of machine learning and causal inference e.g. [recursive partitioning of trees](http://www.pnas.org/content/113/27/7353.full)

**Week 12 (May 3): Wrap-up/project work.**

**Week 13: Project work.**

**Week 14: Project work**
