There will be two assignments you need to hand in to pass this course (not including your final project). Assignments are composed of selected problems from previous weeks. Each assignment will be released immediately after the last session containing problems that may go in the assignment. So if you complete all the exercises in each class session you have very little homework in this course.

**Formalia**
* Groups
    * Assignments should be handed in, in groups of approx. 3 members. Fewer members is allowed, just be aware that all handins are judged the same regardless of the number of members.
    * It is preferred that you work in the same groups throughout the semester.
    * All group members should be familiar with every aspect of each assignment. You can split up writing, editing, etc. but everyone should be able to solve every exercise. If you are unable to solve an exercise don't hesitate to seek help with a fellow student or me. Asking for help will never impact your grade negatively, we're here to learn after all.

* Format
    * Handins must be Jupyter notebooks, with the file format .ipynb.
    * Name the assignment AssignmentX.ipynb, where X is either 1 or 2.
    * Must be anonymous! Make sure you don't write your name anywhere in the assignment, including your code (watch out for absolute file paths).

* Guidelines
    * To make navigating the notebook easier, copy/paste the text of the question you are answering into your own handin.
    * Do not solve all assignments in a single code cell. Split code that does different things into different cells, and explain what cells do, using Markdown (not code comments).
    * Include all code, but keep it short and neat. Write code comments, not for everything, but for the parts of your code that is less self-explanatory.
    * Format plots properly by labeling axes, and including explanatory text for each figure.
    * If you're using code you found somewhere, reference the source. We check for plagiarism, but it's always fine to borrow parts (just not whole solutions).
    * Control the length of your answers. While grading I look at how you prioritize material and whether you expres yourself clearly and succinctly.

* Checklist. Have you:
    * Made sure the document is anonymous?
    * Restarted the Jupyter kernel and made sure that all the code runs without errors?
    * Checked if all of the plots, images and prints are rendered properly?
