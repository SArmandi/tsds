The course Topics in Social Data Science teaches data analysis by using Python and some R. We expect that students have a basic level of understanding of Python and some of Python's core data science packages. For installation check out our [preparation for the 2017 SDS summer course](https://abjer.github.io/sds/posts/2017/07/07/preparing-for-sds.html). The teaching material from the summer course is available [here](abjer.github.io/sds/syllabus) where we cover all the recommended knowledge and skills that we recommend (see below). Some additional external resources are found below.

The most essential skills are basic Python and using Jupyter. We expect knowledge that covers basic data types, data structures, iterative procedures. Besides our summer course there many good Python introductions, for instance [python-course.eu](https://python-course.eu/python3_course.php). 

The most relevant data science packages are: pandas, seaborn and scikit-learn. It is not an absolute necessity that you know all points below for the first class but you are expected to fill out any gaps yourself during the first three weeks. The most relevant skills are:
- Data structuring with `pandas` e.g. input/output, basic arithmetic operations, using groupby and joining datasets. A great short overview can be found in Greg Reda's three part intro [here](http://www.gregreda.com/2013/10/26/intro-to-pandas-data-structures/). 
- Plotting with `seaborn` using explorative plots, e.g. distplot, barplot, regplot, pairplot. It may also be relevant to look at the background plotting framework `matplotlib`. 
- Using `scikit-learn` to apply and evaluate basic machine learning methods e.g. lasso, random forest with cross-validation. 

If you have time we encourage investigating numpy which is how Python works with matrices. 

For more info on these packages check out their GitHub repo's and have a look at the documentation.
